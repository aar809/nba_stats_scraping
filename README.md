# NBA Stats Web Scraping and Analytics with Python

The purpose of this project was for me to familiarize myself with the data analysis pipeline from scraping/extraction, cleaning/ETL, and analysis. 
I wanted to combine my passions in data analytics/data science and sports in order to get the most out of my experience, and to gain insights into sports analytics.
This project is focused on the NBA's current season (2021/2022), and all the data extracted from basket-reference.com and nba.com.

<b>Tools used include:</b>
- BeautifulSoup 
- Selenium
- Pandas
