# NBA Stats Web Scraping and Analytics

The purpose of this project was for me to familiarize myself with the data analysis pipeline from scraping/extraction, cleaning/ETL, and analysis. 
I wanted to combine my passions in data analytics/data science and sports in order to get the most out of my experience, and to gain insights into sports analytics.
This project will be focused on the NBA's current season (2021/2022), and all the data extracted from basket-reference.com and nba.com.

The tools used will be:
- Python's BeautifulSoup 
- Selenium
- Pandas

Tutorials followed:
- Nick from 'Nick's Niches' Youtube channel. (source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxI5tomlDoc&list=PLTUcfu017zJCI7ENgSEK2NjwKp_MJocVL&index=4). I want to thank Nick for creating such a brilliant video series targeting a perfect combination of my interests in data and basketball. Please check out his videos if you are interested as well.
